Algorithmic analysis is all for executing faster on large inputs. Multiple test-cases covering border cases can be tested in one go. To observe order of growth functions you studies in theory by increasing the input size systematically and measuring the executing time. Sooner than later you need to get used to it for other projects, interviews, and programming contests. Debugging tips Extra printf statements help to catch the state of variables at the instances you want to observe. Make sure to put  at end of every such printf statements because sometimes printf statements doesn’t display on the terminal until a full line is sent to the stdout. Use gdb, which is GNU debugger. It’s a tool which takes an executable file and runs it in a controlled way, which allows you to analyze what happens step by step. For that, while compiling using gcc, add an option -g to your command. That adds necessary debugging information to your executable file (a.out in most of your cases). Then run gdb command with a.out as a command line parameter. That puts you into a gdb prompt. gdb has its own qwerty commands, which work in gdb prompt. Learn more about how to debug in gdb.
